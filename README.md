# flight-simulator-cessna172
This C++ program simulates the flight of a Cessna 172, incorporating randomized weather conditions, fuel consumption, and real-time adjustments based on environmental factors. Below is a breakdown of the key components:

üå§Ô∏è Weather System
The Weather class generates random weather conditions affecting the flight:

Wind Speed & Direction: Affects plane heading and power adjustments.
Precipitation: Can be Clear, Rain, or Snow.
Turbulence Probability: 30% chance of severe turbulence, moderate if wind > 30 km/h.
üìå Effect on Flight:

High winds force adjustments in power and heading.
Severe turbulence makes the plane drop altitude.

üõ©Ô∏è Cessna 172 Class (Flight Mechanics)
The Cessna172 class models the aircraft's behavior, handling takeoff, flight adjustments, and landing.

‚úàÔ∏è Key Properties:
speed: The current speed of the aircraft.
altitude: The aircraft‚Äôs altitude above ground.
power: Engine power level in percentage.
fuel: Remaining fuel in liters.
remainingDistance: Distance left to reach the destination.
inFlight: Determines whether the flight is ongoing.
üìå Takeoff Sequence:

The aircraft gradually increases power and speed.
Once it reaches 120 km/h, the plane takes off and ascends to 3,000 meters cruise altitude.
üìå In-Flight Adjustments:

The plane adjusts heading and power depending on the wind direction & speed.
Turbulence can cause altitude changes.
Fuel consumption is tracked per iteration.
If fuel runs out, the plane issues an emergency landing warning.
üìå Landing Procedure:

The plane gradually reduces speed and altitude.
Once it reaches 130 km/h, the landing is completed

üé≤ Randomized Flight Dynamics
The flight distance is randomly assigned between 100-1000 km.
Weather changes periodically during the flight, requiring the plane to adjust dynamically.
